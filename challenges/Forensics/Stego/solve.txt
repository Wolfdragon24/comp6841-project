This challenge involves files concealed inside PNGs, visual information and EXIF data.

1. There are two main initially sources of information. From using EXIFTool, it is possible to identify the string "sggobKQej4 ⚿". By visually analysing the image, it is possible to identify the string "⚿ AB4xnxhRZh". Using the emojis, it can be interpolated that the strings should be connected as "⚿ AB4xnxhRZhsggobKQej4 ⚿" which is a key for a later stage.

2. Using a steganography PNG extractor such as from https://github.com/pedrooaugusto/steganography-png, you are able to acquire a 7z file. However, this file is password locked.

3. Using the key acquired in Step 1, it is possible to unlock the 7z and a file is contained with the flag as the name.
